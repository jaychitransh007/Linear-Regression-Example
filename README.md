# Linear-Regression-Example

In this example we will discuss the impact of different advertising channels on the overall Sales.
We will be using the simple Linear Regression model for training the model

# Regression formula
# y = Bo + B1 *x* X1 + B2 *x* X2 + .... + Bn *x* Xn


In our case the equation becomes:
# Sales = Bo + B1 *x* TV + B2 *x* Radio + B3 *x* Newspaper

Let us train the model and observe the other features
